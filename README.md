# freerouting-jar

⚠️ Do not clone this repository or add it as a submodule. We could modify it whenever we see fit ⚠️

This repository is a mirror of the [Freerouting JAR](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases).

It is meant only to be used as a dependency for the
[`eurorack-blocks`](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks) project.

This repository is not the official Freerouting repository. It exists only because Freerouting
doesn't provide a repository for their releases, and including it as a submodule of the
[`eurorack-blocks`](https://github.com/ohmtech-rdi/eurorack-blocks) project simplifies
installation and automations.

Always refer to the official source. This repository is currently using
[version 1.4.5.1](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases/tag/v1.4.5.1) of the Freerouting JAR.
